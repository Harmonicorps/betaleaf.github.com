**Last Updated**: 2/4/2016 3:09 AM Eastern Time (US &amp; Canada) (UTC -05:00)  
**Reason**: *Add Slim Client. Updated Game to Latest Patch. Have a good day.*

**Updated**: 1/20/2016 12:12 AM Eastern Time (US &amp; Canada) (UTC -05:00)  
**Reason**: *Added Play in Browser Link. Now you no longer need to download.  Sessions limited to 90 minutes. Relogging in fast enough will allow you to reconnect to online games, otherwise play it safe and close the game after an hour and start a new session.*

**Updated**: 1/15/2016 09:43 PM Eastern Time (US &amp; Canada) (UTC -05:00)  
**Reason**: *Fixed an issue where registry changes were not being saved. This bug caused you to lose your saved settings when you closed the app.*

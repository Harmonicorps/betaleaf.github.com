### Always get the Hero you want to play with this Dota 2 InstaPicker.(Formerly HeroSniper)  

Simply run the program, type the hero's name in the box, and start searching for a game.  
The moment character select becomes available, your hero will be automatically selected and confirmed.  

**Features:**  

  - Press F6 to Choose your hero.  
  - Press F7 to toggle on/off auto accepting of matches.  
  - Works at any Windowed Mode or Borderless Resolution.(Untested at uncommon resolutions)  
  - Works on the Arcade Game Modes that use the default Character Select UI. (Sorry AAR players)

### Always get the Hero you want to play with this Dota 2 Instant Picker.(Formerly HeroSniper)  

Simply run the program, type the hero's name in the box, and start searching for a game. The moment a game is found, it will  automatically be accepted and the moment character select becomes available, your hero will be automatically selected and confirmed.  

**Features:**  

  - Press F6 to Choose your InstaPick hero.  
  - Press F7 to toggle on/off Auto Acceptor.  
  - Works at any Windowed Mode or Borderless Resolution.(Untested at uncommon resolutions)  
  - Instant Picker works all game modes that use the Character Select UI. (Sorry AAR players)  
  - Auto Acceptor works all game modes.

Notes:  

  - Works at any Windowed Mode or Borderless Resolution. **Fullscreen Mode not supported.**  
  - Do not have your mouse hover over where the accept and decline buttons will appear.  
  - Enabling the Dota 2 Setting **"Bring to foreground when matchÂ found"** will allow you to auto accept games, even if you have alt tabbed out of Dota 2.  
  - Window Scale must be set to default.

<h3>Can I request my info to be deleted?</h3>
Absolutely! Reply to your help request from the same email address you used earlier that you like to "opt out of data retention" and we will delete all data associated with your email. We will email you when this process is completed. Alternatively, you could email <a href="mailto:admin@betaleaf.net" target="_blank">admin@betaleaf.net</a> or use the contact form at the bottom of this page.

**Why use AndyRoot over other tutorials available online?**  

All the online tutorials I could find are all the out-of-date and don't work or require you to mod the script to get it to work. Unhappy about this, I created my own program to do it for me. Also, this is designed to be a one click root. The closest tutorial I could find required me to run 2 programs.  

**Notes**  

  * Andy does not have to be installed prior to use this. This program will ask you if you want to auto-install Andy if it is missing.

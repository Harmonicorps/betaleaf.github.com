**AndyRoot has reached over 7k downloads. Thanks!** <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>  

**How to use**  
1. [<i class="fa fa-download"></i> Download AndyRoot.exe](https://github.com/BetaLeaf/AndyRoot/releases/).  
2. Run AndyRoot.exe  
3. Follow on-screen instructions.  

**Why use AndyRoot.exe over other tutorials available online?**  

All the online tutorials I could find are all the out-of-date and don't work or require you to mod the script to get it to work. Unhappy about this, I created my own program to do it for me. Also, this is designed to be a one click root. The closest tutorial I could find required me to run 2 programs.  

**Notes**  

  * Andy does not have to be installed prior to use this. This program will ask you if you want to auto-install Andy if it is missing.

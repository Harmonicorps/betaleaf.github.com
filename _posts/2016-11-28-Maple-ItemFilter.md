Ever get tired of lagging or picking up junk and tossing them from your inventory?  
I'll make you an item filter that will prevent these items from causing lag and prevent their pick up.  

For every $1 USD, you will get a 50 item filter. Also accepting 100m mesos as payment.  
The item filter will last the duration of the current patch.  
When a new patch comes out, you will need to reorder your filter.  

They say time is money. That means every second you spend tossing items or lagging is time you aren't making money. Get your time back and order today.

As with all my mods, they are safe and undetectable.  

Note: If you have any of these items you want to filter out in your inventory, you will need to sell/drop them from your inventory before applying the filter. Otherwise, you may crash if you open your inventory.

Ever get tired of picking up junk and tired of tossing them from your inventory?  
I'll make you an item filter that will prevent them from being picked up in the first place.  

For every $1 USD, you get to filter 50 items.  
The item filter will last the duration of the current patch.  
When a new patch comes out, you will need to reorder your filter.  

They say time is money, which means every second you spend tossing items is time you aren't making money.  
Get your time back and order today.

As with all my mods, they are safe and undetectable.

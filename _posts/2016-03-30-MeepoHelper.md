## An Instapoof script for meepo.  

**Feature List:**  

  * Reliable & Fast Blink Poof  
  * Poof All Meepos (without Blinking)  
  * You control how many meepos you use. More Beeps = More Meepos  
  * The safety setting makes Blink Poof more reliable but disables your input during the Blink Poof while it is sending keystrokes or waiting on the blink poof to finish. You will not notice a loss in control most of the time.  
    * Set this setting to False if you do not want the script to disable your input. This can cause meepo to cancel his blink dagger or his clones to stop poofing.

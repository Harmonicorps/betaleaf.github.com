This is a simple tool that automatically accepts any matches found.  

  - Starts enabled. Press F7 to toggle on/off. 
    - Beeps once when off <i class="fa fa-toggle-off"/>.  
    - Beeps twice when on <i class="fa fa-toggle-on"/>.
  - Works at any Windowed Mode or Borderless Resolution. **Fullscreen Mode not supported.**  
  - Works on all gamemodes. 

Notes:  

  - Do not have your mouse hover over where the accept and decline buttons will appear.  
  - Enabling the Dota 2 Setting **"Bring to foreground when matchÂ found"** will allow you to auto accept games, even if you have alt tabbed out of Dota 2.  
  - Window Scale must be set to default.

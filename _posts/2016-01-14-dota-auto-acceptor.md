This is a simple tool that automatically accepts the game when dota manages to find one.
<ul>
	<li>Press F7 to toggle On and Off. Beeps twice when on. Beeps once when off.</li>
	<li>Works at any Windowed Mode or Borderless Resolution. <strong>Fullscreen Mode not supported.</strong></li>
	<li>Works on the Arcade.(Custom Game Modes)</li>
</ul>

Notes: Do not have your mouse hover over where the accept and decline buttons will appear. This changes the color of the buttons and will cause the script to not function because it cannot detect the color it is expecting. Also, using the Dota 2 Setting "Bring to foreground when matchÂ found" will allow you to auto accept games, even if you have alt tabbed out of Dota 2. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/K6nep4m.jpg">Window Scale must be 100%.</a>

Reason: Fixed a bug that prevented this program from functioning at resolutions other than 1920x1080. It will now work on all resolutions as intended. Please comment below if I missed one. Have a good day.

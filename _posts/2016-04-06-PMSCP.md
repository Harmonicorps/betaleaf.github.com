### Your complete solution for watching Movies.  

**Installation Instructions**  

1. Download [PortableApps Platform](http://portableapps.com/download/success).  
2. Download [Plex Media Server Portable](https://github.com/BetaLeaf/betaleaf.github.com/releases/download/1.0/PlexMediaServerPortable.paf.exe).  
3. Download [CouchPotato Portable](https://github.com/BetaLeaf/betaleaf.github.com/releases/download/1.0/CouchPotatoPortable.paf.exe).  
4. Download [uTorrent Portable](https://github.com/BetaLeaf/betaleaf.github.com/releases/download/1.0/uTorrentPortable_online.paf.exe).  
5. Install PortableApps Platform at the root of any drive. (Example: F:\)  
6. Install Plex Media Server Portable, CouchPotato Portable, and uTorrent Portable in the default directories.  

**IMPORTANT**  

  * You must have Visual C++ Redist 2015 (x86) installed to use Plex. Most computers will already have this installed. If Plex refuses to launch, it is because you didn't have it installed. You can download it [HERE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145).  

**Usage**  

1. Run PortableApps Platform (Example: F:\Start.exe) and start Plex Media Server Portable, CouchPotato Portable, and uTorrent Portable.  
2. Once all 3 tray icons show up, Right click on ![CouchPotato's Tray Icon](/I/cp.png) and select "Open" from the menu.  
  * The username and password are both "Plex".  
3. Add any movies you want to watch using the search bar.  
  * Skip this step in the future and [Setup Automation](http://localhost:5050/settings/automation/).  
4. Wait for any movies you want to watch to download via uTorrent.
  * You can access the WebUI [here](http://Plex:Plex@localhost:5051/gui/) and the username and password are both "Plex".  
5. Once the movies get done downloading, double click on ![Plex Media Server's Tray Icon](/I/pms.png) to watch the movies on Plex.  
  * If you have another device you want to be able to watch the movie on, such as a smartphone or smart tv, you will want to **Sign in** and **Enable Remote Access** from the [Settings](http://127.0.0.1:32400/web/index.html#!/settings/server).  

**Notes**  

  * If Movies do not show up, make sure they are not still downloading in uTorrent.  
  * If they are finished downloading but are still seeding, right click on the movie and click Stop.  
  * Movies are automatically moved from uTorrent to Plex on completion of seeding. Do not be alarmed when the movie disappears from uTorrent. It just got moved to Plex.  
  * Need additional help? Email me at [BetaLeaf@gmail.com](mailto:betaleaf@gmail.com).  
  * Be aware of Fake Movies that claim you need to download a codec to watch the movie. Just delete these movies from your library and try another source.

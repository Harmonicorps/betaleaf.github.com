A tool for reducing memory usage. Can be used to release memory caused by a memory leak, although it doesnt fix the issue. It can reduce multiple processes and PIDs and the interval can be set to a cooldown of your liking. 

Run the file once and it will use the default settings. You can close the program and modify the ini file to include any process you want.

Default Processes: chrome.exe;explorer.exe;svchost.exe;MapleStory.exe
